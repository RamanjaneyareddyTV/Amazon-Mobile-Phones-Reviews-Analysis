4,5,02-05-2013,"I purchased this unit for our RV to replace an older AM/FM/Cassette Tape unit.  I was looking for the CD and Bluetooth capability as well as higher quality sound and this unit certainly delivers all of that.  I found the system for setting up the unit took some getting used to.  I believe this process would be simpler if Alpine had provided 1 or 2 more buttons so there was less button multi-tasking.  It took several attempts to finally get a device recognized and connected on bluetooth.  So far, the receiver has linked to my iPad but refuses to link to my iPod Touch or my cell phone.  It also took several attempts to update the receiver firmware but that was finally achieved.  The update has not solved the bluetooth device linking problem.  I plan to contact Alpine tech support to see if they can resolve this issue.  Overall, this is part of a new product line for Alpine and it feels like I'm an early adopter working on the bleeding edge of a new product design.",Receiver Offers a Lot of Flexibility & Complexity

I like it for the most part, touch pad works natively in both Windows XP and in Ubuntu 10.04 without having to install anything. Of course nothing is perfect, there are a few negatives. Once using Windows XP, for some odd reason, the back button stopped working, but then when I booted into Ubuntu, it worked fine, so I believe its a compatibility issue with XP. I managed to fix this with a reboot, and this problem has only happened once and never again. Also once and a while the touch pad doesnt move as fast as it should, but after playing with the pad for a few seconds, it kind of ""wakes"" the mouse back up.

Phones are so inexpensive now, anyway, you'd be much better off taking the money you would have spent on these batteries and putting them toward a new telephone.

2,6,17-01-2003,"I've owned and used this mouse for about 2 weeks and here's my experience.
First, the pluses:
-great, sleek looks
-charger built into the receiver unit
-works great on FLAT surfaces only
-low battery LED indicator
the minuses:
-tracking is TERRIBLE on ALL OTHER SURFACES, ie:  carpet, blanket, couch fabric, matress, etc.
-Logitech drivers will disable certain built in features of Windows XP, many incompatibility issues w/other software
-range is worse than the MS Intellimouse Explorer Wireless
If your mouse sits on a desk all day, I honestly don't think you need a wireless mouse.  However, if you need the range, versatility, and freedom because you have a living room/bedroom/familyroom pc setup where you may want to use the mouse on some surface other than a desktop, wireless is the way to go...but Logitech is DEFINITELY NOT the way to go.
I couldn't believe how horrible this product performed after reading so many rave reviews about it, so I returned my first MX700 for another brand new one, but that one still had the same problems.  I guess none of the reviews tested this unit on other surfaces besides a desktop.
Feel free to buy the MX700 and test it out on your own but if you plant to use this mouse on anything but a flat surface, make sure you save your receipt and box because you'll most likely want to return it later.  I gave my MX700 away to my little brother who will use it at his desk exclusively and I went out and bought the MS Intellimouse Explorer Wireless and, to my surprise, I've never had a SINGLE tracking problem using it on textured and non-flat surfaces.  We've even wrinkled up a blanket and tested both mice:  the MSIEW worked flawlessly, the MX700 was a joke.  Even my little brother wants to Ebay his MX700 now and get the MSIEW.
Some ppl complain about the MSIEW's lag time due to it's sleep mode and it's only about 1/2sec, all I do is nudge the mouse as I place my hand on it to wake it up before I use it and that works fine.  Trust me, it's alot less inconvenient than you think and A WHOLE HECK OF ALOT less frustrating than watching your cursor jitter and dance all over your screen because of tracking problems.
Bottom line is, if you're only going to use your mouse on a desk, get this one...but, if you need your mouse to work on a wide range of surfaces, get the MSIEW.  Personally, I think the whole point of wireless is that you don't plan to use your mouse on a desk, because if it's less wires on your desk that you're after, remember that EVERY wireless device needs to have a receiver on the desk and that, my friend, still has wires.  (until they come up with a wireless receiver for the wireless receiver) =P
Hopefully someday, either Logitech or Microsoft will combine the best features of these two mice into one product.",Doesn't live up to the hype
1,0,30-09-2013,"The info about tripod compatibility in the listing is not really specific, but I can confirm that it fits the 055CXPRO4 model tripod.  You do have to wrestle the rubber end piece off of the column before inserting it into the tripod, and wrestle it back on once installed. Repeat the struggle every time you swap it out with the regular column.

With this short center column and this tripod, the lowest height achievable for the platform on which the ballhead will sit is 12 inches from the ground.  This is quite a bit higher than Manfrotto states for my tripod (4.53 inches), and is not acceptably low in my opinion.  Forget about Manfrotto if you want to do macro shots, or any shots, from close to the ground.  I am very unhappy with the ensemble because it cannot be set low enough, contrary to Manfrotto's false specification.  Try Really Right Stuff, as I wish I had done.",Compatible with my Manfrotto 055CXPRO4 tripod -- but still not a low platform.

4,8,23-03-2012,"After seeing that this was about $1 cheaper than Kodak BW400CN, I decided to give it a go. One of my Magic Lantern guides mentioned this film as intriguing, and that it something everyone should try once! Well, I did, and this is what I found:

PROS
- In the right conditions, grain is very fine compared to other 400ISO films
- Produces relatively sharp images
- In the right conditions, it has excellent contrast

NEUTRAL
- C41 process, can be developed at any place that develops film

NEGATIVE
- Without great lighting, grain becomes overpowering in larger prints (no, really)
- Doesn't deal with high dynamic range too well in bright sun, i.e. sometimes TOO contrasty

Overall, I'll keep a small stock of this when traveling and I can't develop my own film, but I much prefer true black and white films as a rule. If you are going on a sun-filled vacation, this is one you want to leave at home - even for a 400ISO film it doesn't do well in the sun. I much prefer how Kodak's BW400CN interprets dynamic range and contrast, and while this was an advanced film in its time, I can't understand how it has managed to stick around aside from the amateur market. Fun to try, probably a good one for a day of non-essential shooting! I usually LOVE Ilford films - if you look at my fridge it probably accounts for 80% of my stock - but this one seems to be one of those ""convenience over quality"" decisions companies make sometimes.","Interesting, not a game-changer."

That said one of the best things about this mouse is that it never goes to sleep. It is not like other mouse's that will stop working or go to sleep in the middle of using it. In fact even when you come back to it after some time it is always ready to work.

1,11,08-09-2007,"I bought this camera because I have owned several Minolta Maxxum film cameras over the years including the origional Minolta Maxxum 7000 from the early 80s.  Since I already had several lenses I thought it was a no brainer purchase.

Until I went with a friend and shot photos at the Arizona Reinsanance festival.  He was there with his Canon 20D.

We both shot photos of the bird show and I compared photos later with what he had taken and what I got.

Then he let me borrow his camera and take some shots.

Let me tell you!!!

The auto focus on a Canon camera IS LIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF ANYTHING MINOLTA HAS!!!  His Canon with a 70 - 200 F4 L USM lens can focus from minium distance to infinity and take dozens of photos while I'm still trying to get my Minolta 5D to focus with any lens at any distance.  Since then I have tested a new Canon 30D with a Canon 400mm USM L 5.6 against my Minolta Maxxum 75 - 300 Lens.  The Canon lens can focus in micro seconds even faster then my 50mm Minolta Lens!!!!  You don't even want to hear how slow the 75 - 300 lens is not only can you not track birds in flight with the Minolta lens you are lucky to get the shot at all.

Then when comparing the shots taken in darker areas with higher ISO his shots at ISO 1600 looked better then mine at 400!!!

I ended up buying a Canon 400D Rebel XTi and what a shock.

I have tested my Minolta 5D and several of the new Sony Maxxum lens mount cameras back to back against my Canon and it's no contest.

Bottom line, if you want a camera that can focus on and track a bird IN FLIGHT! then get a Canon DSLR with USM focusing and forget the Minolta non-sense with their body driven focusing motor in the camera body.

My daughter had been using my Minotla 5D for awhile we were shooting some birds her with the Minotla and me with the Canon.  I handed her my Canon with a 70 - 200 2.8 L Lens and she aimed the camera out and focused and took her first shot.  She looked at me in disbelief!!  She said what the heck, how can it focus so FAST!!!  THIS IS AMAZING!!!!

If I had never compared I would have never know how much better a camera can be.

Go to any store and try a new Canon XTi Rebel or Canon 30D or 40D and see for your self!!

I have since put up my Minolta cameras and lens for sale.

Good luck Sony, you will need it.",Very slow auto focus very poor high ISO performance
